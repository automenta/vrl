This file contains comments (of all available types) and is intended for correct
comment detection (comments inside strings shall be excluded etc.).

Expected parser behavior:

# strings                    = 4 (2xdouble, 2xsingle)

1. escaped quotes inside string environment

a = "this is an escaped \" (double quote)"
a = 'this is an escaped \' (single quote)'

2. unescaped single quotes inside double quote environment and vice versa

a = "we use ' inside \" env"
a = 'we use " inside \' env'
